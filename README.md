# Algorithms Visualization 

This application visualizes various sorting and searching algorithms using Swing in Java. It allows users to select
different sorting algorithms and visualize their sorting process in real-time.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- Visualize searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.
- Real-time visualization of sorting process.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later.
- Swing library.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Once the application window opens, you can select a sorting algorithm from the control panel and observe its
   visualization in the main panel.

## Controls

- The control panel allows you to select different sorting algorithms.
- Click on the buttons corresponding to the sorting algorithms to start their visualization.
